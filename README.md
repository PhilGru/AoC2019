#### Requirements
My solutions for the Advent of Code Challenge of 2019. All solutions are written using the python standard libraries, no extra modules required.

#### IntCode Computer
For the recurring "IntCode" Computer of days 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 and 23 I copied the code into the python script for the specific day to maintain self contained solutions. The Code did not change past day 11.

#### Disclaimer
For some later days (especially the graph related puzzles), the code gets very ugly. For some of them, I have ideas how to do things cleaner, and for some I just didn't know better. Since the time I wanted to allot to this challenge is limited, I almost never refactored any of the code after getting the correct solution, even if I know a better/cooler/cleaner solution.
